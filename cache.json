We will provide updates as necessary.\nAug  3, 06:10 UTC\nScheduled - Fastly’s global network is growing, and with that growth comes changes and enhancements in some of our naming conventions and best practices. Refer to our server.identity and server.hostname pages on Developer Hub for an in depth explanation of the new cache naming schema. Starting no earlier than Thursday, 12 Aug 2021, we will begin populating the node name in some situations according to a new scheme.\nWe’d like to share these changes so that if our customers are performing any troubleshooting or logging these values, one can not only know with certainty exactly what node processed a request, but also update any log parsing or automation to properly parse these values.\nPlease note that for most of our existing infrastructure, the naming scheme is not changing, and you will continue to see these values set to the previous scheme for some of your traffic and log data. We suggest that if customers are parsing these fields out and breaking them down into individual values (such as the node name and POP) to adjust any tooling or automation to be able to handle both formats.\nFeel free to reach out to our support team if you have any questions on these changes.\nserver.identity\nserver.hostname",
